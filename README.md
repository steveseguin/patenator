Goal of this project is to make an open library of ideas, so that patents can't later be claimed on them, hurting the small-time inventor who may not think its worth while patenting, can't patent, or doens't know how, etc.

By making your idea open, and searching, you undermine others from patenting the idea in the future, blocking you from working on your own idea.

Even if you dont want to share you idea, capturing your idea in a formal setting can be used as prior art to undermine patent trolls attacking you in the future.

Unlike provisional patents, there is no cost here.
